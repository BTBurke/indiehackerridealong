# Finding the right business for you

One of the biggest mistakes I've made in past projects is not thinking enough early on about what type of business I want to start.  This time around I am going to introduce a framework to evaluate each of my ideas.  Without some way of gauging which ideas are actionable, you run the risk of biting off more than you can chew or undertaking a project for which you have neither the skills, capital, or time to pull off.  This is less about deciding which ideas are good or bad - that is a validation exercise whose answer is ultimately decided by your target market.  Rather, this is about evaluating the resources at your disposal and picking ideas that fit both your available time/capital/knowledge and meet your definition of success.

## Defining Success

The first step is picking a definition of success.  For some, this will be replacing a full time job, building a multi-person company, or simply making enough to augment some other gig.  It could be something non-monetary - building a portfolio that lands you a coveted job elsewhere, or making a difference for a cause you care about.

I have a great career that I don't plan on leaving any time soon.  For that reason, I have modest goals - on the order of $2,000USD MRR - would allow me to take better vacations with my family or spend more on my other hobbies.  

Why is this important?  Starting with the goal in mind tends to rule out some projects right away.  If you need to replace your income and you come from a high cost of living country, you may have to target larger pain points, compete directly with more established businesses, or need more money to finance your growth.

Setting your sights on a more modest success, as I am in this case, means you're free to look at smaller, niche problems or pick strategies that allow you to grow slowly.

## A Framework for Evaluating Ideas

From my past failures, I've come up with a list of requirements that I use to evaluate my ideas before I even try to validate them with the market.  Like me, you may have tons of ideas that just aren't actionable on an indie hacker path.  I won't be creating the next Facebook, or competing with Uber to break into the sharing economy.  Some ideas, while great, may not be realistic given the typical indie hacker's time, budget, and work capacity (assuming you'll be working alone without funding, like most of us.)

This time around, I'll be evaluting my ideas using these metrics:

* **Solo product development, marketing, and support:**  It must be a small enough problem that I can develop, market, and support the product with the full time job.  That doesn't mean that certain things can't be outsourced for efficiency's sake, but it places a limit on those problems that require extensive full-time development by a team of people or are so technically challenging that they are beyond my capacity.

* **B2B self-service sales**:  B2C is often more challenging to monetize, with lower margins, and higher marketing costs.  I prefer B2B problems because businesses are more likely to pay to solve a pain point and are generally less price-sensitive.  A further requirement is that self-service sales would be represent the majority of customers acquired.  I don't want to pick an idea that requires an inside sales team, white glove on-boarding, or long sales cycles to close the deal.  This rules out large classes of enterprise software that require this type of sales effort.

* **No more than 3 month CAC payback:** 

* **At least 80% margin on customer LTV:**

* **Unique selling proposition:**

* **At least two viable marketing channels (no more than 1 paid):**
