# Finding the right business for you

One of the biggest mistakes I've made in past projects is not thinking enough early on about what type of business I want to start.  This time around I am going to introduce a framework to evaluate each of my ideas.  Without some way of gauging which ideas are actionable, you run the risk of biting off more than you can chew or undertaking a project for which you have neither the skills, capital, or time to pull off.  This is less about deciding which ideas are good or bad - that is a validation exercise whose answer is ultimately decided by your target market.  Rather, this is about evaluating the resources at your disposal and picking ideas that fit both your available time/capital/knowledge and meet your definition of success.

## Defining Success

The first step is picking a definition of success.  For some, this will be replacing a full time job, building a multi-person company, or simply making enough to augment some other gig.  It could be something non-monetary - building a portfolio that lands you a coveted job elsewhere, or making a difference for a cause you care about.

I have a great career that I don't plan on leaving any time soon.  For that reason, I have modest goals - on the order of $2,000 MRR - would allow me to take better vacations with my family or spend more on my other hobbies.  

Why is this important?  Starting with the goal in mind tends to rule out some projects right away.  If you need to replace your income and you come from a high cost of living country, you may have to target larger pain points, compete directly with more established businesses, or need more money to finance your growth.

Setting your sights on a more modest success, as I am in this case, means you're free to look at smaller, niche problems or pick strategies that allow you to grow slowly.

## A Framework for Evaluating Ideas

From my past failures, I've come up with a list of requirements that I use to evaluate my ideas before I even try to validate them with the market.  Like me, you may have tons of ideas that just aren't actionable on an indie hacker path.  But how do you know?  I think it's important to set realistic boundaries so the project can get finished with your available time and budget, and you should rule out those that violate more than two of your tenets.  I won't be creating the next Facebook, or competing with Uber to break into the sharing economy.  Some ideas, while great, may not be realistic given the typical indie hacker's time and budget (assuming you'll be working alone without funding, like most of us.)

This time around, I'll be evaluting my ideas using these metrics before I even start talking to my target market, and ruling out those that are just too costly or time-intensive:

* **Solo product development, marketing, and support:**  It must be a small enough problem that I can develop, market, and support the product with a full time job.  That doesn't mean that certain things can't be outsourced for efficiency's sake, but it rules out those problems that require extensive full-time development by a team of people or are so technically challenging that they are beyond my capacity, given my limited time.

* **B2B self-service sales**:  B2C can be more challenging to monetize, with lower margins, and higher marketing costs.  That often means you need other people's money to get it off the ground.  I prefer B2B problems because businesses are more likely to pay to solve a pain point and are generally less price-sensitive.  The potential pitfall in B2B is sales: selling to enterprise customers can be a long and difficult process.  But, there are many classes of B2B problems where you can hit a benefit/price point where you don't need a sales team and your customer will just whip out his credit card to solve some acute pain.  I don't want to pick an idea that requires an inside sales team, white glove on-boarding, or a long sales cycle to close the deal.

* **No more than 4 month CAC payback period:** For venture funded startups, they often need to hang on to a customer for more than a year before they pay back the initial cost to acquire her.  For indie projects, that can cause you to incur a lot of debt up front, and then churn can ensure that you are in the hole for a long time, even when you have paying customers.  To get out of that situation, you need to shorten that CAC payback period, by either lowering the cost of acquisition by using cheaper marketing channels, raise your prices, or reduce your operating costs.  While you generally can't know from the outset exactly what your CAC payback period will be, I rule out ideas where I'm clearly looking at high acquisition or operating costs.  Ideas that fall into this category often seem great at first, but can quickly become unmangeable: video streaming, two-sided markets, or ideas that require paid ads in high competition areas. 

* **At least 80% margin on customer LTV:**  This goes hand in hand with payback period above, but it deserves its own bullet.  Before building anything, I try to math out how much I think I'll be paying to acquire a customer and what my operating costs will be.  If I can't feasibly hit 80% margin, I rule it out because low margin, high volume businesses are really full time jobs by themselves.  This might apply to physical products, drop shipping, affiliate sites, and the like.

* **Unique selling proposition:**  I'm sure many people make good money doing me-too businesses where they copy a successful product and try to compete on price.  Although that might be a lucrative side gig, I quickly lose interest unless I think I have something new to bring to the table.  That doesn't mean I'm going to blaze a new trail in a completely untested market, but I want to find some USP that I think improves on the state of the art.  This helps immensely with actions further down the line, especially crafting marketing copy.

* **At least two viable marketing channels (no more than one paid):** This can also be unknowable at the outset, but certain ideas clearly rely on paid advertising.  I think paid ads are fine, especially if you think you can reach your audience on one of the under-utilized and, thus, cheaper channels.  However, I rule out any ideas that rely *solely* on paid ads to work.  I believe that as an indie hacker you really have to leverage long term plays like content marketing, side project marketing, or SEO.  If I have no idea how I would reach my target audience through one of those channels, I discard that idea.

* **No two-sided markets:** In one past project, I tried a two-sided market idea, and from that I learned that these chicken-and-egg problems are expensive.  When an idea relies on network effects or the presence of the other side of the market before a customer gets any value, it's just really difficult and expensive to convince either side of the market to show up.  That's where you have to go all in on marketing to quickly reach critical mass.  For an indie hacker without a huge VC marketing budget, I think this is too difficult.

* **Product development time of less than 1.5 months:** We all know that 1.5 months is really 3 months in development time, so I try to pick problems that can be solved in 6 weeks of work or less.  I find that is enough time to tackle a somewhat difficult problem, but doesn't let you go down the rabbit hole of product development and wasting time building something no one wants.

## My plans for this ride along

I started this site for two reasons:

* There are a lot of great blogs out there about how to do X or Y, but rarely do you find a full accounting of building a business from zero to something.  Often when we listen to podcast interviews from successful founders, there might be a bit of revisionist history about how they got to where they are.  It also doesn't help that there aren't a lot of specifics about what they did step by step that might help others.

* For me, it's an exercise in accountability.  I have so many projects that I've started and not finished.  Many had great initial metrics that meant they might have been viable businesses.  But then work and life gets in the way and I lose that motivation to continue, knowing that I have nothing on the line.  I still have my full time job and a pretty good life.  This time, I want that extra push to take my next project across the finish line.  It may fail, but at least I will have documented everything I tried and learned.  I hope that will help others.

And my promise to those who want to follow along:

* I'm going to practice radical transparency, keeping track of exactly how much time I spend on each task, my process at every step along the way, and share the complete results and data right here for posterity.

* This is an open platform that is not just about my journey, but your's too.  If you are starting a project and want to offer a ride along to others, feel free to [contribute](/contributing.html).  I have no plans to monetize this site.  This is purely an exercise in giving back to the community and sharing our progress in a completely open and honest way.
